ques.1  Explain what the simple List component does.

Ans. The simple List component is a React component that renders a list of 
items with the ability to select an item. It consists of two sub-components,
 SingleListItem and List. The SingleListItem is a memoized functional 
component that renders a single item in the list. The List component is also
 a memoized functional component that maps over an array of items and renders 
a list of SingleListItem components.
